    "## DrQA \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements model proposed in the paper: [Reading Wikipedia to Answer Open-Domain Questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00051) which is called DrQA by the authors. Specifically, DrQA is an end-to-end system for open domain question answering which involves an information retrieval system as well. This notebook however only explains the deep learning model proposed by them. This model is very similar to the one explained in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02858) paper. The first authors in both the papers are also the same. The latter model is also known as \"Stanford Attentive Reader\" and is one of the models that is explained in Chris Manning's lecture on QA.   \n",
    "The flow of all the notebooks will be as follows:\n",
    "* Data Preprocessing: This section prepares the data for training and involves trademark NLP preprocessing steps. The functions being called here are imported from the script `preprocess.py`.\n",
    "* Model: I've tried to explain the intuition behind each layer/component of the model.\n",
    " > *Texts coming from the paper are in block quotes like this.*   \n",
    " \n",
    " Along with the intuition, I explain how equations written in paper can be transformed into code to the best of my ability.\n",
    "* Training: While I have tried my best to use similar training procedures as mentioned in the paper, there can be some changes. I do not have unlimited access to GPUs. \n",
    "* References: I provide an exhaustive list of resources/references that I used at the end of each notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tensor Based Approach\n",
    "All the notebooks are based on this approach. Ultimately, building neural nets is all about working with tensors. Knowing the shape and contents of each tensor is something that I have found very useful. Hence, after each line of code, I have commented the tensor shape and changes that happen due to the transformations in code. This makes the process of understanding whats going on in neural nets more intuitive.\n",

We then use `torch.bmm` to calculate the product in the numerator of $a_{i,j}$, mask the product and then pass it through the softmax function to get $a_{i,j}$. Finally, we multiply this with the question embeddings. The output of this layer is an additional context embedding which is then concatenated with the glove embeddings."

    "## Introduction to Attention in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "Attention as a concept in NLP was introduced in 2015 by Bahdanau et al. to improve neural machine translation systems. Before this paper, NMT systems were largely based on seq2seq architectures which had an encoder to encode a representation of the source language and a decoder which to decode this representation into the target language. Such models were trained on large quantities of parallel text data of two languages. One major drawback of this architecture was that it didn't work well for longer documents/sequences. This is because the entire information in the source sentence was being crammed into a single vector. If this vector fails to capture the important information from the source language, the system is going to perform poorly.   \n",
    "<img src=\"images/seq2seq.PNG\" width=\"600\" height=\"700\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we claim that these neural nets mimic the human brain, this is certainly not how the human brain works. While *learning* about some topic, we do not simply read 2-3 pages of content and expect our brain to remember all the details in the first go. We usually revisit various concepts, recollect and refer to the material back and forth before mastering it. The attention mechanism in NMT was designed to do this. While decoding at any particular time step, encoder hidden states from all the time-steps are made available to the decoder. The decoder then can look back at the encoder hidden states or the source language and make a more informed prediction at a particular time-step. This alieviates the problem of all the information from source language being crammed into a single vector.  \n",
    "To illustrate this with equations, consider that the hidden states of the encoder RNN are represented by $H$ = {$h_{1}, h_{2}, h_{3},...,h_{t}$}. While decoding the token at position $t$, the input to the decoder unit is hidden state from previous unit $s_{t-1}$ and an attention vector which is a selective summary of the encoder hidden states and helps the decoder to pay more attention to a particular encoder state. \n",
    "The similarity between the encoder hidden states $H$ and the decoder hidden state so far $s_{t-1}$ is computed by,  \n",
    "$$ \\alpha = tanh (W [H ; s_{t-1}]) $$   \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\alpha$ is then passed through a softmax layer to obtain attention distribution such that $\\sum_{t} \\alpha_{t}$ = 1.\n",

The following layer does not actually calculate the attention as a weighted sum. It just uses the bilinear term's representation to predict the span.

Our loss function ensures that our objective is to predict different positions from the context. It is now the neural net's responsibility to learn different weights for each layer. It is sort of a \"black-box\" and we have to trust the process of backpropogation."
